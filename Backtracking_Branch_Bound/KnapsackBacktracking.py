# Step 1: Start with items having weights, values, and a capacity.
# Step 2: Start from the first item.
# Step 3: Include the current item if it fits in the knapsack.
# Step 4: Calculate the current weight and value.
# Step 5: Move to the next item.
# Step 6: Also try the case of excluding the current item.
# Step 7: Compare both choices and keep the maximum value.
# Step 8: Continue until all items are checked.

# Time Complexity: O(2^N)
