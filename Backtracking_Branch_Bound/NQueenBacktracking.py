# Step 1: Start with an empty N × N chessboard.
# Step 2: Place the queen from the first row.
# Step 3: Try each column in the current row.
# Step 4: Check whether the position is safe:
#     No queen in the same column.
#     No queen on either diagonal.
# Step 5: If safe, place the queen and move to the next row.
# Step 6: If all N queens are placed, print the solution.
# Step 7: If no safe position is found, remove the previous queen and backtrack.
# Step 8: Try the next position until all solutions are found.
# Time Complexity: O(N!) approximately
# Space Complexity: O(N²) + O(N) recursion stack.
