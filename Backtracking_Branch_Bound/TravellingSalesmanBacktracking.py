# Step 1: Start from the first city.
# Step 2: Add the current city to the path.
# Step 3: Try each unvisited city.
# Step 4: Calculate the cost of moving to the next city.
# Step 5: Move to the next city and continue.
# Step 6: If all cities are visited, return to the starting city.
# Step 7: Compare the total cost with the minimum cost.
# Step 8: Remove the city and backtrack to try another path.

# Time Complexity: O(N!)
# Space Complexity: O(N) recursion stack.
